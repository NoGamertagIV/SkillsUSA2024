    <p>Welcome to Amici Vecchi Dog Rescue, where every tail has a tale and every dog finds a friend. Our journey began six years ago, with a chance encounter that changed everything. It was a rainy night when we found Max, a senior dog wandering along a busy highway. Little did we know, Max would become the inspiration behind our mission to give every dog a second chance at a loving home.

        In that moment of rescue, a seed was planted, and from it grew a flourishing community dedicated to saving lives. With over 150 dogs saved each year and a team of 20 dedicated volunteers, our commitment to providing sanctuary and love knows no bounds. Our humble beginnings have blossomed into a haven for dogs in need, housed in a converted barn on our property, where wagging tails and joyful barks fill the air.
        
        At Amici Vecchi, our passion for rescue runs deep, fueled by the unwavering support of our community and the guidance of our dear friend John, the animal officer who helped us embark on this journey. Together, we're not just rescuing dogs; we're rewriting their stories, one adoption at a time. Join us in our mission to give every dog the chance to become an old friend and find their forever home.</p>
